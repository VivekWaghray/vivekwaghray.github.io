I am a General Business minor and in the QUEST Honors program (a multidisciplinary program that has students do real-world consulting programs). I am interested in doing something with tech like software engineering or tech consulting. For general hobbies, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, reading, and spending time with friends. </p>
